# The benefits of a growth mindset

A growth mindset helps you grow in whatever you pursue, especially in your work.

### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset believes that you can develop your abilities by perseverance and effort.
On the other hand, a fixed mindset believes that your abilities are fixed and success comes from these inherent qualities.

### Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset

1. Challenges

** It is important to solve Challenges using the growth mindset; you have to try another way for solving when your way is not working **
2. Obstacles

My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else. I lose focus, just like it says in the chart above. Whether it’s clicking a tempting bookmark in my browser, nipping out to grab a coffee, or just about anything to delay keeping at it and fighting through the discomfort. A coworker calls this “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions – articles, videos, email, social – mere clicks away.

3. Effort

`No pain, no gain` is pure growth mindset!

4. Criticism

You have learned to ask your self two questions:

1. What was the best part of the day?
2. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
These questions help you focus on all aspects of your day, the good and the bad, and they help you internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.

5. Success of others

The success of the others don't affect you.

### Growing at work, and outside work too

I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.

Maybe all this seems obvious to you, in which case, you’re lucky. For me, I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work. When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it. A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.

### How to keep yourself in a growth mindset?

1. Keeping trying
2. Go out of the comfort Zone
3. Work Hard
