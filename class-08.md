== | Equail (The type may not be the same)

2. ## JS for and while loops

#### Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
#### Often this is the case when working with arrays:

- ### The For Loop.

#### The for loop has the following syntax:

### Syntax
```
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- ### The While Loop.

#### The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### Syntax
```
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
