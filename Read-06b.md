1. ### Hardware and Software:

#### Hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case,[1] central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.

#### Software is a program that enables a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system (hardware).

#### By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.

#### Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.

2. ### Binary & Data:

#### Binary data is a type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system. Binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer. It is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones.

3. ### Circuits and Logic:

#### Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit.
#### Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate.
